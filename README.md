My first steps in recommender systems

## TODO
- [ ] Data. Possibilities:
-- Retail Hero data
--- Pros.:
---- A lot of context (contextual based algos)
--- Cons.:
---- Hard to find
---- Possibly to big for my poor little macbook air 2017
---- Could be not as much transactions as expected
-- [MTS books data](https://www.kaggle.com/sharthz23/mts-library) 
--- Pros.:
---- Straight forward transactions without bullshit
---- 1.5 actions
--- Cons.:
---- No context
